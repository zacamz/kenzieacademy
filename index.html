        <p>This is the first week that I started to work on the debugger. Really diving deep into what a makes a good function, also spent a good section of study hall examining what pure functions are how they work. Haven't coded any unit test but will be looking more into those these week </p>

            <summary>Creating Functions and Getting Ahead</summary>
            
            <p>Since Beginning this course I have felt very driven to fully grasp the topics and week 5 did not have much in the way of reading or really that hard of an assignment.
              I had to turn it in before I could advance to week 6's lesson. So after finishing that assignment on Sunday I turned it in and pushed forward. This may have been a bit
              premature as I am pushing beyond all of the other students but I have been asked for help by a total of three other learners. On the first day of class we were given a 
              task to create a function to calculate the number of seconds since someone was born. both this weeks assignment are listed and linked below.

            <p>The following assignment was very benefical, it really showed me how I can work in a team setting to accomplish a goal. For one it allowed me to check my own work by 
              writing my own code and evaluating it with a team and getting their feedback and let them put their strengths into my code. In the end the product came out exactly as it
              needed to be. Even the teachers examples matched mine super well.

            &#11088; Getting Input and Giving Output: Basicly</summary>
  
          <p>On week 6, I was well ahead of the curve and was pushing on to Week 7 at the same time as these assignments. So far this was the most challenging week; as there was a Discovery challenge too. The core lesson was on using the prompt function as well as the document.write function to get input from the user and display it to the HTML page. I can already see that this is not a good practice but it was exciting to get some input from the user.<br> Below is the file and link to the github repository for the assignment for the week. It was a pretty fun one as all of the functions we worked on had in a way real life applications and could potentially be useful if the rest of the internet did not exist. This was also an assesment so it made up a larger portion of my grade and I did not go too above and beyond with this one </p>

          <p>	<h3>&#11088; Discovery Project &#11088;</h3>
            <p> Also this week, we had our first Discovery Project which is like extra credit but we don't get extra credit, more of like a stretch goal if you felt up to the challenge.The challenge was to credit a MadLibs puzzle, and the base file was pratically already filled out you only had to add a few more fields to get a passing grade (this is an actually assignment for the normal course but was just extra practice for us). On this project I really did push my self and wanted to go above and beyond. I used pseudo code to figure out what I needed and wanted from my code, I used the readme for that although it may not be the best practice. I did reasearch ahead of time on how to use arrays and how to add to them as I submited more entries as used the array.push function. I then moved all of my prompts inside of the function and then moved away from the varibles to have just the function inside of the madlibs itself. Not only all of that but this was my first time trying my hand at CSS. I wanted to evoke the idea of doing an actual madlibs but putting the logo, simmular text, a color that sort of looks like paper and border to get that classic madlibs shape! I used an actual madlibs that was free on their website and gave them the credit on the page. Give it a try! </p>
